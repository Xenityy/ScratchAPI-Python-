## Sending Information
Requires you to sign in.
scratch3api.Send('username','password') has one subclass:
### Comment
Comments stuff

Example use:

* `Profile('username','comment')`
* `Project('Project ID','comment')`

### These are not part of a subclass
This is used to set a cloud variable

Example use:

* `cloud('Project ID','Variable Name','Variable Value')`

These are used for following:
* `follow(username)`
* `unfollow(username)`

Invite someone to a studio:
* `invite('Studio ID','username')`

# Planned Updates
I have to get these in raw html, so it'll be harder for me to program them:
* Reading comments
* Reading your 'What's Happening' Section
* Reading user activity
* Finding projects a user recenty viewed, loved, or favorited
* Following/Unfollowing topic forums
