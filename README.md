# ScratchAPI-Python-
A web API interface for [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), written in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

* [`Getting Started`](#getStarted)
* [`Future Updates`](#updates)

## You have two options to get the files:
<a name="getStarted"></a>
### Do it manually
* Download the .zip and extract the files
* Then upload the file into whatever you are running the file on (I recommend [Replit](https://replit.com))
## or
### Run this in python
```python
import subprocess
subprocess.call('git clone https://github.com/pikachub2005/ScratchAPI-Python-Installer', shell = True)
```
* Move the files into the same folder that the previous file is in.

And you're all set! The markdown file explains how to use it.
